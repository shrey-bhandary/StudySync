                   StudySync - Academic Dashboard
                    Project by: Shreyas B | UID: 2405054
------------------------------------------------------------

🔷 Project Summary:
StudySync is a personal academic dashboard built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (planned). It is designed to help students manage their academic life more efficiently by providing tools like an assignment tracker, subject resource manager, Pomodoro timer, and sticky notes — all in a clean and minimal interface.

The goal is to keep everything organized in one place without the need for logins or advanced backend systems. This project is fully front-end based and uses vanilla HTML and CSS for the first phase.
